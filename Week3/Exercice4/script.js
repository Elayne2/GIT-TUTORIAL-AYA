let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a+b) //first expression
// Prediction:The outcome is 55 because 34+21=55
// Actual:55

a = 2;

console.log(a+b) //second expression
// Prediction:Te outcome is 23 because 2+21+23
// Actual:23

// C doesn't have a value since we didn't define it

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
// 3 and 4 are numbers which is not the cas for '5' since it is a string so 3+4=7 and 7+'5'=75
